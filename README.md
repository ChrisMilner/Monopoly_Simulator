# Monopoly_Simulator

The monopoly simulator project aims to create a platform that can be used to create competitive Monopoly AI for educational purposes. When people are looking to improve their programming skills there is often a lack of interesting projects to take on which don't require building a whole project yourself. This project aims to provide a platform where users can practice programming and improve their skills by creating AI to run algorithms.
